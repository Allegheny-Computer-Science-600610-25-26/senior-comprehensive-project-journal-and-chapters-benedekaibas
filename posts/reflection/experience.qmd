## What is the Presentation About?

For our senior comprehensive project it is required for us to give a presentation about our prototype. This presentation serves as a proof that
we know the fundamental of our topic, our chosen research and/or tool is feasible, and that we are able to identify the place of our project in
today's world computer science, software engineering. The presentation is also good for preparing us giving the final presentation at the end of
next semester when we have to present our final senior comprehensive project.

Overall, we can say that this presentation is a preparation for the upcoming final presentation next semester and also a "test" to show that our
senior comp is feasible, we started working on it, and we can ship a prototype which serves as a small, restricted version of our final tool
and/or research.
