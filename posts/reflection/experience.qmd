## What is the Presentation About?

For our senior comprehensive project it is required for us to give a presentation about our prototype. This presentation serves as a proof that
we know the fundamental of our topic, our chosen research and/or tool is feasible, and that we are able to identify the place of our project in
today's world computer science, software engineering. The presentation is also good for preparing us giving the final presentation at the end of
next semester when we have to present our final senior comprehensive project.

Overall, we can say that this presentation is a preparation for the upcoming final presentation next semester and also a "test" to show that our
senior comp is feasible, we started working on it, and we can ship a prototype which serves as a small, restricted version of our final tool
and/or research.

## Preparing for My Presentation

First, I've thought that preparing for a presentation and creating slides are easy, but the preparation this time proved that I was wrong. It is
actually pretty hard and complicated to make good slides for a presentation. Also creating THE perfect presentation is almost impossible since
there is always something that we can do better, but our goal is not even to make THE perfect presentation of ALL TIME. Rather we want to 
connect our audience to our presentation and involve them in our talk, so they understand our topic and will be curious about what we are doing.

I have created my slides pretty early during the semester, but the more I've met with professor Kapfhammer during office hours the more I have 
realized that the current state of my presentation's slides are not as good as I've thought first. We actually spent 2-3 office hours just to
create, finalize, and practice my presentation. It was a pretty long and interesting process, but at the end it totally did worth it.

Preparing for my first presentation included the following tasks: creating the prototype of my tool, gathering research papers, creating the
slides for my presentation, finalize everyting, and preparing for the presentation itself.
