## Current Version of My Senior Comprehensive Project

At this point I have implemented the prototype of my tool and gave my first presentation for the Senior Seminar. So far my prototype works
as I expect it to work, but there is still a lot to do in order to make it 100% done working with my research paper. I think, if I continue
putting the work into pytifex then it can be a very good reseach paper delivered with an automated code generator that would help developer
teams working on type checkers. I am really looking forward on what the future holds for this research!

## What Challanges Did I Face So Far?

Implementing pytifex (or any other reserch tool & paper) is a very exciting progress, but it takes time and requires the person to put the 
hard work into it. I am in a very fortunate situation, because I get help from such a great professors like professor Kapfhammer and professor
Luman that are not just supporting me during this work, but also give me all their resources, knowledge, and experience. I really feel that my
comp is not just my achievement, but also the achievement of these two professors. Their help reduces the challanges I have to face during the 
implementation part of pytifex.

One of the challanges I face several time is turning my ideas into code and make sure it works how I expect it. I have to give a prompt to the 
LLM Agent that I choose to work with and the pompt matters a lot. If the prompt is not good enough then the generated examples won't force type
checkers to create either false positive or false negative code examples. I was making so many different prompts and tweak the ones I found good
soo many time, but I never really get the feeling of "yes, this is the solution that will work on a general basis". Then I talked about this with
professor Kapfhammer and he highlighted the point which was that "your prompt matters, but not as much as you think, if you change your strategy".

So, what is the strategy? Instead of making a long prompt, I should just tweak the message to the LLM Agent not to give me code back until there isn't
disagreement between the type checkers. By that I also ask the LLM to run type checker in it's code generating process which is another tool in the automated
process. After that I get code samples that have better quality and when I run type checkers automatically on these examples, it will more likely lead to cases
where some or all of them report false positive or false negative.

## Is a Problem a Problem or a Challange?

I really feel that, if you enjoy doing something then you do not really face problems, but rather challanges that make you excited to work on -to be honest they do
not always make me excited-, but in 99% of cases they do! This also leads not just to a better tool, but also gives me more knowledge and experience that will be beneficial
in the future for my professional work for sure.
