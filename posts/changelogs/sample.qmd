### Reaching v1.0: A Retrospective on Pytifex and My Senior Thesis

**Phase 1: Prototyping and Tool Development**
The path to this 1.0 release began with the hands-on development of the **Pytifex** prototype. I didn't just want to theorize about static
analysis; I wanted to build something functional. I spent the early part of the project architecting the tool to successfully interact with
GitHub's API, creating the logic to extract closed issues, and developing the initial mutation engine. This phase was about turning the abstract
idea of "testing type checkers" into a concrete piece of software that could actually run against tools like `mypy`.

**Phase 2: Academic Writing (Chapters 1 & 2)**
While building the tool, I simultaneously worked on the academic foundation of the project. I drafted **Chapter 1**, focusing on the motivation
and the specific problem statement regarding false positives in Python. Following that, I conducted extensive literature reviews to write
**Chapter 2 (Related Works)**, where I analyzed the current state of the art in static analysis and identifying the gap my research fills.
Writing these chapters helped me clarify exactly *why* Pytifex is necessary and grounded my coding decisions in actual research data.

**Phase 3: Feedback Loops and Presentations**
A crucial part of this process was the continuous feedback loop. I regularly met with my professors to ensure the scope was manageable yet
significant, and I engaged in discussions with my classmates to refine my approach. I also delivered formal presentations that forced me to
defend my methodology and articulate my progress clearly. These discussions were vital; they helped me pivot when necessary and kept the project
aligned with its goals.

**Phase 4: Documentation and Weekly Updates**
Throughout the entire semester, I maintained a steady stream of documentation. Writing the weekly posts wasn't just a requirement; it was a way
to track my own progress and document the hurdles I overcame in real-time. This consistent reporting led directly to the creation of the project
website, which now serves as the public face of the work.

**Conclusion: The v1.0 Release**
All of these distinct efforts—the coding, the chapter writing, the meetings, and the presentations—have culminated in this v1.0 release. The
prototype has matured into a release-ready state, the website is live on GitHub Pages, and the first two chapters are polished and integrated
into the final thesis PDF available in the repository.
