## Short Feedback On My Current Work

As we approach the end of the semester I completed my chapter one and I am right now working on my chapter 2 for the senior comprehensive project.
I am also developing my automated code generator tool called pytifex. This tool will support my research paper which is an Empirical Study
on Static Analyzer Toolsets to Reduce False Positives, False Negatives in Python Type Checkers. Pytifex automatically generates code examples based
on closed issue templates from well-known type checkers. Then it regenerates those examples in a way that would force type checkers to report false
feedbacks.

I am right now focusing on my chapter 2 and fine tuning my tool. For the rest of the semester I will finish my chapter 2 and also make progress in pytifex,
so I can start making test cases that would support my research.

## Feedback For Evan's Chapter One

Evan's chapter one was pretty solid in terms of detailed explanation, output of his tool, correct styling, and carefully implemented grammar. Just like my
chapter one was before professor Kapfhammer reviewed it, I felt the same with Evan's chapter one, that it was not a research paper phrased introduction, but more
like a blog post that was very technical detailed, but I still did not feel the tone of a formal research paper.

However, his senior comprehensive project is more focused on delivering a tool than implementing a research paper, so in his case it might be good to write his chapters
in the format he has it currently. Also including pictures from various websites do not really give the feeling of a research paper, so I suggested him to change that for
his chapter one.

## Feedback For Keven's Chapter One

Keven's project is pretty interesting as well. I recommended Keven to remove place holders, and content not related to his final research paper. Also his title is not updated
on his paper yet. His `List of Figures` was orgranized like a `Table of Contents`, so that was a styling issue. His description of chapter one was solid and I could understand
his idea, what the project is about, and what is his strategy to finish his tool. I recommended him to do more styling and remove unused content, so with that the LaTeX format
will be correctly displaying his table of contents, list of figures, chapter numbers.

On the last node, I suggested him to include more research papers and during our discussion I provided him one research paper that I think would perfectly fit into his comprehensive
project.
