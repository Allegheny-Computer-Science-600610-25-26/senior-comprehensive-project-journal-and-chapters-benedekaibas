thesis. By the end of this introduction I hope you will have a better idea about my research!

# Problem We Face

Type related errors are the leading errors in Python programming language according to (Oh & Oh, 2022). We have static analysis toolsets that are
scanning our source code and without running it they produce analysis. The feedback of these static analysis tools or type checkers is important for
developers to determine, if their code has type related errors. However, these type checkers are not working perfectly and they tend to produce false positive
or false negative reports.
