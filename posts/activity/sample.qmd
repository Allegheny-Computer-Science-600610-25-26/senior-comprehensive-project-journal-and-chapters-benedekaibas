## The Title

I was thinking a lot about choosing the correct title for my tool. I wanted something meaningful, but also related to Python and the research
I am working on. Since, my tool is an automated code generator to test different type checkers made for Python, my goal was to include it somehow
in the name of the tool. I really feel like my project is kind of a "bridge" between today's problem - which is the fact that we do not know 100%
which type checker is the most reliable and where should we focus on improving them - and the future where we can generate many code examples by
one command and evaluate type checkers.

## First Part of the Title

Since I could not really include type checker in the name I went with python and I just used Py. By looking at these two letters everyone knows
in the computer science world what is the target language. That is the reason why I have thought that it is a good first part of the name.

## Second Part of the Title

The second part is more complex. Like I mentioned, I think of my project as a "bridge" between two worlds. I wanted to include history and a little
mistery in the name of the tool. That is the reason I chose "tifex" as the second part. This comes from the term Pontifex Maximus which means
"the greatest bridge-builder". This title was adopted by Roman emperors. I did not want to include Maximus in the name of pytifex since it would sound
too arrogant for me. Also the name sounds good when I pronounce it, so I thought it is a good name for the tool.
