Hey there! My name is Benedek Kaibas and I am a senior computer science student at Allegheny College. My senior thesis is An Empirical Study
on Static Analyzer Toolsets to Reduce False Positives, False Negatives in Python Type Checkers.  

I am interested in C++ and Compiler programming while also researching in the static analysis area of Python!
