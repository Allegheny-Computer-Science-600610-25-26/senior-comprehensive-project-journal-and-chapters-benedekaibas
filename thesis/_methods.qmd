## Overview and System Architecture

Pytifex employs a four-stage pipeline to systematically generate test cases that expose type checker bugs: (1) mining bug reports from type checker repositories, (2)
LLM-based mutation to generate semantically similar variations, (3) differential testing across multiple type checkers to identify disagreements, and (4) runtime validation
to establish ground truth.
Figure 3.1 illustrates this architecture.

**Figure 3.1:** Pytifex system architecture. Seed bugs mined from closed GitHub issues are mutated by Gemini to produce semantically similar variants that may trigger related
failures across different type checkers. Valid variants are tested across four type checkers to identify disagreements. Disagreement-triggering programs are executed at
runtime; `TypeError`, `KeyError`, or `AttributeError` constitutes definitive evidence of a false negative. The pipeline guarantees that 100% of final outputs are confirmed
false negatives.

The pipeline's design reflects two key insights from our analysis of related work. First, differential testing alone cannot determine which type checker is correct when
disagreements occur—it only signals that at least one implementation is wrong. Second, historical bug reports encode precisely which language features and type constructs
tend to trigger checker failures, making them valuable seeds for generating new test cases.
