abstract: |
  Python’s dominance in large-scale systems necessitates robust static type checkers like Mypy and Pyright. But as the language evolves, who
  verifies these tools? We introduce Pytifex, a framework that bridges the gap between theoretical fuzzing and real-world defects. Unlike
  random code generators, Pytifex mines and mutates closed GitHub issues to create targeted, adversarial test cases. This column details how
  data-driven differential testing reveals significant soundness gaps in major type checkers. We offer a roadmap for tool maintainers to use
  these refined examples to fortify the Python ecosystem against false diagnostics.
