abstract: |
  Python’s continued evolution and frequent releases of type checkers (e.g., mypy, pyrefly, and ty) create the need for a proactive
  verification technique. This paper introduces Pytifex, an automated differential testing agent that generates source code examples to expose
  edge cases and blind spots in Python type checkers. By using LLMs seeded with historical bug reports mined from GitHub repositories, Pytifex
  synthesizes known failures to generate novel code examples that surface contradictions among type checkers. These type checking disagreements
  reveal potential validity gaps and edge cases, aiding both the creators of type checkers and the software engineers who use them.
